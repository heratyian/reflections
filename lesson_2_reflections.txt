What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

    when you initialize a repository, git creates a .git file in the
    current directory. You need to do this before making commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is for files to be commited. Add files that have
    been changed and logically make sense for the commit. Easier to track
    bugs later on.
