When would you want to use a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?

    When working with other people on the same files it is
    advantageous to use a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Other people might also be working on the same repo. If you are
    always up to date with the remote, you might lose your changes.
